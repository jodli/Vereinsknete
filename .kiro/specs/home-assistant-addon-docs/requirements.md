# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for packaging VereinsKnete, a fullstack Rust+React freelance time tracking and invoicing application, as a Home Assistant add-on. The goal is to make VereinsKnete easily installable and manageable through the Home Assistant Supervisor interface, allowing users to run their personal time tracking and invoicing system alongside their home automation setup.

VereinsKnete is a modern web application that helps freelance service providers track billable hours and generate professional invoices. It features user profile management, client management, session tracking, PDF invoice generation, and a responsive dashboard. The application uses Rust with Actix-web for the backend and React 19 with TypeScript for the frontend.
